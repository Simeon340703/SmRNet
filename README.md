This is the PyTorch implementation of SmRNet: Scalable Multiresolution Feature Extraction Network. The network is a versatile backbone for various computer vision tasks such as detection, classification, and tracking. It offers scalability options, ranging from tiny to large configurations. If the GPU can handle it and there is a sizable training dataset, the network can be expanded by adding more layers.
